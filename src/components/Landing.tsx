        <p className="subAbout">
          I am a software developer with a focus on full-stack web application
          development. I primarily use React with either Vite or Next.js for
          frontend development. I have used JavaScript/TypeScript and Spring
          Boot for backend servers implemented in both monolithic and serverless
          architectures for APIs. AWS is my go-to when it comes to
          infrastructure hosting. My most used services on AWS are S3, Lambda,
          DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
